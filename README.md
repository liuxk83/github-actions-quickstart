# GitHub Actions Quickstart
This repo was used to demonstrate the steps listed in the [GitHub Actions Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

Feedback: When providing the reader with the `github-actions-demo.yml` file, it might be useful to elaborate more on how the file works, e.g., how different steps (name, run, uses, etc.) work. Because the reader may not have previous experience with .yml files, this could provide the reader with a foundation for understanding other .yml files and perhaps even writing their own.
